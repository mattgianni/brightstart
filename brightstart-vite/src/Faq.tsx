                                Our school is like that perfect bed in
                                Goldilocks - it's just right. Being small allows
                                us to provide one on one attention. For
                                activities we form small groups according to
                                each child's age development. We respect each
                                child's development and help them to develop
                                lifelong skills. We are licensed by the state
                                for 12-14 children per day dependent on their
                                ages.

                                We are a home-based preschool licensed by the

                                large outdoor area - a fun setting to explore
                                and learn!

                                We serve nutritious meals for lunch and
                                breakfast. We serve milk and water, no juice. We
                                provide organic fruits and vegetables as much as
                                possible and believe that good nutritious meals
                                lead to lifelong healthy eating habits.

                                For naptime the child can take a nap or just
                                rest and enjoy quiet time. We believe this
                                downtime is important for small children and
                                even if they don't sleep, it's important they
                                have this break in their day.

                                just around the neighborhood but always safely
                                and with parent's permission. We also do Field

                                This is something we take seriously and urge our
                                families to as well. We ask our families to
                                please keep sick children home to prevent the
                                spread of illnesses. In the case of something
                                like a mild cold our staff will still work,
                                making sure we wash our hands and take the right
                                precautions. We help the children to wash their
                                hands before meals. We clean our toys and
                                equipment daily with a water based solution and
                                we make sure we have fresh air rather than
                                stuffy, closed up rooms.

                            <p>
                                Our method is to use redirection and positive
                                discipline. Once we get to know the child we try
                                to predict situations and deal with them
                                individually. We help the child to find a
                                solution and give them options on how to solve a
                                problem. Sometimes the child will need to
                                regroup. In that case, we will remove the child
                                from the situation until she/he is ready to come
                                back on her/his own. If the child continues to
                                misbehave we will work together with the parents
                                for the best solution. If the safety and well
                                being of the other children and or staff becomes
                                a concern the child may be removed from the
                                program.
